On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway

Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year)

She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How theyâ€¦
